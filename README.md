# Hangman
Hangman Game. 

Done over the summer as a refresher for C++.

This is run through the console window.
There are opportunities to reuse code so that'll be in the next update if there is one.
"0" "1" "2" : are used for game modes
  *If you use anything else, it'll punish you for not following instructions*
"a" "b" "c"... "z".."1".. "{": to enter a character
"word" : to enter multiple characters at once

Game Modes:
Easy:
  Enter in 0. You'll receive a max of 9 wong answers to guess the word. 
Medium:
  Enter in 1. You'll receive a max of 6 wong answers attempts.
Hard:
  Enter in 2. You'll receive a max of 3 wong answers attempts.
Extremely Hard:
  Enter in anything else because you mistyped or for whatever crazy reason, and you lose if you get one wong.


Bugs:
  If the first space in the uncovered word is not guessed then a weird symbol is placed there.
  We will say it is intentional so I don't have to fix it.
  
Typos:
  Wong is not a typo. It is for all those who are named Wong, Rong, etc. 
  Sorry, not sorry Cindy. Your last name will be used for all my projects.
